Yet, if the risk is great, such as irreversible damage to our environment, should we not consider the cost of inaction to be potentially even greater? What do you think is the wise course of action when the stakes are the survival of certain ecosystems or even human lives?\n",

Meanwhile, might it also be wise to prepare modestly for the chance that the current consensus on climate change might be correct? After all, the virtue of prudence lies in balancing between different kinds of risks.\n",
