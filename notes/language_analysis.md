# 5 Manipulation Techniques

Sure, here are simple explanations for the five manipulation techniques commonly used in misinformation:

1. **Emotionally Manipulative Language**: This is when words are used to play with people's emotions in order to influence their thoughts or actions¹. It's like using scary words to make people afraid so they believe something that isn't true⁴.

2. **Incoherence**: This refers to information that is confusing or not clear⁵. It's like someone telling a story that jumps from one thing to another without making sense, making it hard for you to understand what's really going on⁷.

3. **False Dichotomies**: This is when only two choices are presented as if they are the only options, when in fact there could be more⁹[^10^]. It's like saying you can only have cake or ice cream for dessert, when you could also have cookies, fruit, or nothing at all.

4. **Scapegoating**: This is when blame is unfairly placed on an individual or group for a problem¹⁴¹². It's like blaming your little brother for the broken vase, even though it was the cat that knocked it over.

5. **Ad Hominem Attacks**: This is when someone attacks a person's character instead of their argument¹⁷¹⁸. It's like calling someone stupid instead of explaining why their idea won't work.

These techniques are often used to mislead people and avoid genuine debate or discussion.

## Examples 

1. **Emotionally Manipulative Language**: "If you don't vote for this candidate, our country will be destroyed and our children will have no future!" This statement is designed to evoke fear and manipulate people into voting for a particular candidate.

2. **Incoherence**: "Our economy is in shambles because of the aliens from outer space who control the world's gold reserves." This statement is confusing and doesn't make logical sense, making it difficult to understand the real message.

3. **False Dichotomies**: "You're either with us, or you're against us." This statement presents only two options, ignoring the possibility that someone might be neutral or have a more nuanced position.

4. **Scapegoating**: "The immigrants are the reason we're losing jobs." This statement unfairly blames a particular group (immigrants) for a complex issue (job loss).

5. **Ad Hominem Attacks**: "Don't listen to her arguments about climate change, she's just a tree-hugger." This statement attacks the person (calling her a "tree-hugger") instead of addressing her arguments about climate change.

## Examples of Papers tackling this topic 

Here are some papers that analyze these manipulation techniques:

1. **Emotionally Manipulative Language**:
   - "Crowdsourced Detection of Emotionally Manipulative Language"¹: This paper discusses the detection of emotionally manipulative language in text. It introduces an approach, anchor comparison, that leverages workers' ability to identify and remove instances of emotionally manipulative language in text to create a paraphrased "anchor text", which is then used as a comparison point to classify emotionally manipulative language in the original content¹.

2. **Incoherence**:
   - "The disaster of misinformation: a review of research in social media"⁵: This paper reviews the spread of misinformation in social media, which often includes incoherent information. It discusses the characteristics of misinformation in different domains and strategies to control its spread⁵.

3. **False Dichotomies**:
   - "COVID-19 false dichotomies and a comprehensive review of the evidence regarding public health"⁸: This paper deconstructs six common COVID-19 false dichotomies and addresses the evidence on these topics. It highlights knowledge gaps and uncertainties, and argues against black-or-white messaging and one-size-fits-all approaches⁸.

4. **Scapegoating**:
   - "The disaster of misinformation: a review of research in social media"⁵: This paper also discusses scapegoating as a form of misinformation in social media. It highlights how certain groups can be unfairly blamed for complex issues as part of misinformation campaigns⁵.

5. **Ad Hominem Attacks**:
   - "Ad Hominem Fallacies, Bias, and Testimony"¹³: This paper discusses ad hominem fallacies where an individual employs an irrelevant personal attack against an opponent instead of addressing their argument. It explores how biases, particularly unconscious biases, can make ad hominem fallacies seem effective, even when their irrelevance is recognized¹³.
