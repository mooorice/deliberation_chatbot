# Todos

- Get & Implement Party Manifestos from EU&I

- Build Qualtrics Survey

- Implement information from survey

- Include seeds and system fingerprint

## Survery Requirements
#### Before Treatment
- Survey starts with short generic introduction
- Some form (unfortunately I didn't note whicht one) that already exists - Andrea will specify and implement
- Pledge to answer truthfully (already exists) - Andrea will implement
- Questions about Sociodemographics ?(gender, age, eductation, income)?
- Politics
    - Ideology space in 2 dimensions:
        - economic: market vs state, e.g. welfare state vs low taxes
        - sociocultural: freedom/civic liberties (e.g. abortion or gay rights)
    - What is the most important political issue to you?


        - Look for questions from german election study (GESIS)

- Dependent Variables (Pre?)

#### Treatment with Chatbot
- Implement survey data
- Either non political discussion or socratic discussion

#### After Treatment

Manipulation Check: 
- Check if those in the treatment have the feeling they had a serious political conversation (2 asects: socrattic maeutic, self deliberation)

- Something to show that the conversation made them understand more (open ended) 

Turnout intention:
- How likely are you to vote for this years EU election?

Party preferance:
- How likely is it that you would vote for each of these partys?

- Measure of internal political efficacy (how well individuals think they understand a problem)

- external political efficacy (people distrust politicians possibly because they don't understand it themselves)

- 4 items of scale of intelectual humility by Andrea
